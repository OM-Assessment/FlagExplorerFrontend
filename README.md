This is the Angular frontend for the Flag Explorer App. It displays country flags and related information by consuming a .NET 8 backend API.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code

## 🚀 Quick Start with PowerShell

To clone the repositories, install dependencies, and run both frontend and backend:

1. Open PowerShell
2. Run the script below or save it as `setup.ps1` and execute it:

```powershell
# Setup Script for FlagExplorer Frontend and Backend

Write-Host "Starting setup for FlagExplorer App..."

# === CONFIG ===
$frontendRepo = "https://github.com/OM-Assessment/FlagExplorerFrontend.git"
$backendRepo = "https://github.com/OM-Assessment/FlagExplorerBackend.git"
$frontendFolder = "FlagExplorerFrontend"
$backendFolder = "FlagExplorerBackend"

# === NODE & ANGULAR SETUP ===
if (-not (Get-Command node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)) {
    Write-Host "Node.js is not installed. Please install it from https://nodejs.org/"

    exit 1
}
